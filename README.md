A repository for the functions that I find myself rewriting over and over
again, but are too small to be a stand-alone library.

* Python
    * [x] Timer as a context manager
    * [ ]
* Go
    * [x] Struct to pretty-printed JSON:`PrettyJSON`
    * [x] Exponential Backoff Polling:`ExpBackoff`
    * [x] Ping/Is Remote Port Open?:`Ping`
    * [ ] Named regex function
